# Mass machine type transition
This project contains the k8s job that will perform a mass machine type transition on an OpenShift cluster.

### Notes
Currently this is repository is very much a WIP. There are several different functions that I've written that perform the same basic task of updating the machine types. However, there are modifications that need to be made to some of these, or functionality that needs to be added to fulfill all of the requirements needed. As of now, many of these functions are standalone and have yet to be connected into a cohesive process. I have been going back and forth between several different designs/implementations so the current functions are all the results of those various designs. With that in mind, I am working on starting to connect all the pieces together to have a cohesive, working project.
